Unsupervised Learning On Materials Data

This project aims to apply unsupervised learning techniques to materials data from the Materials Project, a database that provides a wealth of information on various materials, including their properties, compositions, and structures. The goal is to discover hidden patterns, group similar materials, and identify potentially novel materials or relationships between material properties.

This [data](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Materials_Project_Data/7227749?file=13309250) was extracted from the Materials Project by Anubhav Jain and others.

## Analyses
Anomaly Detection - Use isolation forest to detect anomalies\
Clustering - Cluster the data using K-means clustering\
Visualize - Visualize clusters and anomalies
